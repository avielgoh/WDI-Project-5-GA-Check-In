  Thanks for taking the time to check out my code (more info at: https://github.com/avielgoh/WDI-Project-5-GA-Sign-In).

  This project was undertaken as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course I undertook in late 2015. My client was General Assembly, specifically the Events Management Team.

  If you like what you see, I'd love to buy you a coffee (or icecream) and chat further. Please feel free to contact me at:
